"""Tier 3 — hybrid escalation + safe ``verified:true`` write-back.

Promotion rules (only ever ``false -> true``, never a demotion):
* band green AND >=1 cited source is a *live* Tier-1 host  -> auto-promote
* Tier 2 cross-reference returned ``confirm`` (exact heading) -> promote
* otherwise stay unverified, with a logged reason

Write-back is *surgical*: only the ``"verified": false`` token is rewritten to
``true`` in the raw bytes. Full re-serialization is intentionally avoided because
the seed files keep short arrays inline (``[64, 128, 256]``) while ``json.dumps``
would expand them, producing a huge spurious diff and defeating the "only verified
changed" guard. Edits are atomic (temp file + ``os.replace``) and preserve LF.
